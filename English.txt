===== Commonly used expression =====
* //fine with/by me//  used to express permission (or no objection)
* //fine for me // used when  //fine in my opinion//  is meant
* //derive  //vs.  //deduce//
  //deduce// impliziert eher grobe Abschätzung, nicht Verwendung von Formel [e.ho]
* //whose//  cannot be simply replaced by  //which//  (but by  //of which //)
	→ //which // is not necessarily a possessive noun
	   "I placed the phone whose screen was broken in the bin"              	OK
	   "I placed the phone which screen was broken in the bin"          		NOT OK
	   "I replaced the phone, the screen of which was broken, in the bin"   	OK 
* //I'm one hundred percent sure//  vs.  //I'm a hundred percent sure//  
	* first one gives a greater impression of certainty (in speech, "one" would be emphasized)
	* in negative sentences, one would write  //I'm not a hundred percent sure//


===== Figure caption =====
* //Courtesy of Hans.A.//  = mit freundlicher Genehmigung von Hans.A.
* NOT: //Courtesy Hans.A.//

* formal: 				//Sincerely//, //Kind regards//
* less formal:				//Regards//  followed by only first name
* very relaxed:			//Cheers//
* heavy email exchange:	//Thanks//
* adjust to your email partner


===== Happen vs. occur =====
* //to happen// is closely associated with blind chance, it basically means something random to take place
* //to occur// is a bit more definite
* //to result// is very definite as it means "to arise as a consequence, effect, or outcome of some action, process, or design"

===== Compound words =====
Source: https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/889/when-should-com-pound-words-be-writ-ten-as-one-word-with-hy-phens-or-with-spac
Three types of compound words exists in English:
1. The closed form: words are melded together, such as firefly, secondhand, softball, childlike, crosstown, redhead, keyboard, makeup, notebook
2. The hyphenated form: daughter-in-law, master-at-arms, over-the-counter, six-pack, six-year-old, mass-produced
3. The open form: post office, real estate, middle class, full moon, half sister, attorney general

In general, compound words that are created by adding a prefix are not hyphenated, e.g. anteroom, extraordinary and coordinate. 
Some exceptions are:
* compounds in which the second element is capitalized or a number: anti-Semitic, pre-1998, post-Freudian
* compounds which need hyphens to avoid confusion: un-ionized (as distinguished from unionized), co-op
* compounds in which a vowel would be repeated (especially to avoid confusion): co-op, semi-independent, anti-intellectual (but reestablish, reedit)
* compounds consisting of more than one word: (poster's note: these are phrasal adjectives) non-English-speaking, pre-Civil War
* compounds that would be difficult to read without a hyphen: pro-life, pro-choice, co-edited

Hyphenation is also used to join a word to a past participle to create a single adjective preceding the noun it modifies: "a well-intentioned plan," for example, or "a horseshoe-shaped bar."


===== Getting to know each other in conversations =====
* "How are you"	 --> "Thank you, everything is fine/quite okay/I can't complain"
				   --> don't talk about problems
* no title in names
	  "Hi, I am Winfried Unhold"				OK
	  "Hi, I am Prof. Dr. Winfried Unhold"		NOT OK
* Beruf eher beschreiben als betiteln
	   "I teach chemistry at university" 		OK
		   "I am tenured professor of chemistry"	NOT OK
* no religion, politics, finances
   --> fine is weather, vacations, sports, travel/journey to current meeting


===== Negotiations =====
* sich selbst nicht so wichtig nehmen: "heute morgen ist mir was blödes passiert...."
* kein "Mansplaining" oder Besserwisserei
* kein direktes "No" oder direkte Aufforderung
   "Call Hans!" ----> "You might want to call Hans"
								"Why don't you call Hans?"
   "That isn't possible" ----> "I'm afraid that it may be difficult"


===== Irregularities of spelling and pronunciation =====
**The Chaos** is a poem written by Gerard Nolst Trenité (1870–1946, Dutch). It nicely illustrates the irregularity of English spelling and pronunciation, including about 800 examples of irregular spelling. The probably most popular version of it was published by the Spelling Society in 1993/94:

	Dearest creature in Creation,
	Studying English pronunciation,
		⁠I will teach you in my verse
⁠		Sounds like corpse, corps, horse and worse.
	It will keep you, Susy, busy,
	Make your head with heat grow dizzy;
		⁠Tear in eye your dress you'll tear.
		⁠So shall I! Oh, hear my prayer,
	Pray, console your loving poet,
	Make my coat look new, dear, sew it?
		⁠Just compare heart, beard and heard,
		⁠Dies and diet, lord and word,
	Sword and sward, retain and Britain,
	(Mind the latter, how it's written!)
		⁠Made has not the sound of bade,
		⁠Say—said, pay—paid, laid, but plaid.
	Now I surely will not plague you
	With such words as vague and ague,
		⁠But be careful how you speak,
		⁠Say break, steak, but bleak and streak,
	Previous, precious; fuchsia, via;
	Pipe, snipe, recipe and choir,
		⁠Cloven, oven; how and low;
		⁠Script, receipt; shoe, poem, toe,
	Hear me say, devoid of trickery:
	Daughter, laughter and Terpsichore,
		⁠Typhoid; measles, topsails, aisles;
		⁠Exiles, similes, reviles;
	Wholly, holly; signal, signing;
	Thames; examining, combining;
		⁠Scholar, vicar and cigar,
		⁠Solar, mica, war and far.
	From "desire": desirable—admirable from "admire";
	Lumber, plumber; bier but brier;
		⁠Chatham, brougham; renown but known,
		⁠Knowledge; done, but gone and tone,
	One, anemone; Balmoral;
	Kitchen, lichen; laundry, laurel;
		⁠Gertrude, German; wind and mind;
		⁠Scene, Melpomene, mankind;
	Tortoise, turquoise, chamois-leather,
	Reading, Reading, heathen, heather.
		⁠This phonetic labyrinth
		⁠Gives moss, gross, brook, brooch, ninth, plinth.
	Billet does not end like ballet;
	Bouquet, wallet, mallet, chalet;
		⁠Blood and flood are not like food,
		⁠Nor is mould like should and would.
	Banquet is not nearly parquet,
	Which is said to rime with "darky".
		⁠Viscous, viscount; load and broad;
		⁠Toward, to forward, to reward,
	And your pronunciation's O.K.
	When you say correctly croquet;
		⁠Rounded, wounded; grieve and sieve;
		⁠Friend and fiend; alive and live;
	Liberty, library; heave and heaven;
	Rachel, ache, moustache; eleven.
		⁠We say hallowed, but allowed;
		⁠People, leopard; towed, but vowed
	Mark the difference, moreover,
	Between mover, plover, Dover,
		⁠Leeches, breeches; wise, precise;
		⁠Chalice but police and lice.
	Camel; constable, unstable;
	Principle, disciple; label;
		⁠Petal, penal and canal;
		⁠Wait, surmise, plait, promise; pal.
	Suit, suite, run, circuit, conduit
	Rime with "shirk it" and "beyond it",
		⁠But it is not hard to tell,
		⁠Why it's pall, mall, but Pall Mall.
	Muscle, muscular; gaol; iron;
	Timber, climber; bullion, lion,
		⁠Worm and storm; chaise, chaos, chair;
		⁠Senator, spectator, mayor.
	Ivy, privy; famous, clamour
	And enamour rime with "hammer."
		⁠Pussy, hussy and possess.
		⁠Desert, but dessert, address.
	Golf, wolf; countenance; lieutenants
	Hoist, in lieu of flags, left pennants.
		⁠River, rival; tomb, bomb, comb;
		⁠Doll and roll and some and home.
	Stranger does not rime with anger,
	Neither does devour with clangour.
		⁠Soul, but foul and gaunt, but aunt;
		⁠Font, front, wont; want, grand, and, grant,
	Shoes, goes, does.[1]) Now first say: finger,
	And then: singer, ginger, linger.
		⁠Real, zeal; mauve, gauze and gauge;
		⁠Marriage, foliage, mirage, age.
	Query does not rime with very,
	Nor does fury sound like bury.
		⁠Dost, lost, post and doth, cloth, loth;
		⁠Job, Job, blossom, bosom, oath.
	Though the difference seems little,
	We say actual, but victual,
		⁠Seat, sweat, chaste, caste; Leigh, eight, height;
		⁠Put, nut; granite, but unite.
	Reefer does not rime with "deafer,"
	Feoffer does, and zephyr, heifer.
		⁠Dull, bull; Geoffrey, George; ate, late;
		⁠Hint, pint; senate, but sedate;
	Scenic, Arabic, pacific;
	Science, conscience, scientific;
		⁠Tour, but our, and succour, four;
		⁠Gas, alas and Arkansas!
	Sea, idea, guinea, area,
	Psalm; Maria, but malaria;
		⁠Youth, south, southern; cleanse and clean;
		⁠Doctrine, turpentine, marine.
	Compare alien with Italian,
	Dandelion with battalion,
		⁠Sally with ally; yea, ye,
		⁠Eye, I, ay, aye, whey, key, quay!
	Say aver, but ever, fever,
	Neither, leisure, skein, receiver.
		⁠Never guess—it is not safe;
		⁠We say calves, valves, half, but Ralf!
	Heron; granary, canary;
	Crevice, and device, and eyrie;
		⁠Face but preface, but efface,
		⁠Phlegm, phlegmatic; ass, glass, bass;
	Large, but target, gin, give, verging;
	Ought, out, joust and scour, but scourging;
		⁠Ear, but earn; and wear and tear
		⁠Do not rime with "here", but "ere".
	Seven is right, but so is even;
	Hyphen, roughen, nephew, Stephen;
		⁠Monkey, donkey; clerk and jerk;
		⁠Asp, grasp, wasp; and cork and work.
	Pronunciation—think of psyche!—
	Is a paling, stout and spikey;
		⁠Won't it make you lose your wits,
		⁠Writing "groats" and saying groats?
	It's a dark abyss or tunnel,
	Strewn with stones, like rowlock, gunwale,
		⁠Islington and Isle of Wight,
		⁠Housewife, verdict and indict!
	Don't you think so, reader, rather,
	Saying lather, bather, father?
		⁠Finally: which rimes with "enough,"
		⁠Though, through, plough, cough, hough, or tough?
	Hiccough has the sound of "cup"......
	My advice is—give it up!
