====== Productivity ======
Created Montag 23 Mai 2022

General tips:
1. Time is the most valuable ressource
2. Identify most important task and simply start doing it
3. Rather work from calendar, not from To-Do list (as To-Do lists can quickly become a graveyard of ideas)
4. Trying to avoid future procrastination by getting rid of future excuses (i.e. putting running shoes next to bed)
5. End day when you're tired, not when you're finished
6. Always carry a notebook
7. Control email-/messenger-inbox (turn-off notifications on phone helps, instead look at inbox only 2 or 3 times per day)
8. Say no to (long) meetings if possible
9. Say no to things not supporting your main current goal
10. Focus on your strengths and passion
11. Days can have different main themes (i.e. catch-up on phone calls for one day, fully work on main project for another day)
12. Everything requiring less than 5 minutes should be done immediatly instead of putting it on a list, "touch everything once"
13. Strengthen body and mind during early morning routines


4 tools are often recommended:
1. Notebook
	a. App for phone + PC and synchronization across them is mandatory
	b. Using different folders within the notebook app, where one should be for quick notes
	c. One folder should be for ideas for future projects, papers, collaborations, videos, etc.
	d. General checklists for re-appearing stuff, like e.g. organize trip
	e. Personal folder is useful
	f. Archive folder to remove things from the other notebooks (without actually removing them)
2. Calendar
	a. Reminders are useful
	b. Synchronize across mobile + PC
3. To-Do list
	a. 3-5 items per days is ideal (more than 7 and it starts to look like too much)
	b. Breaking things down into small tasks to not miss something
	c. Weekly overview, i.e. seeing what's on for next days is helpful
	d. Having some fixed, optionally visable, lists might be useful (groceries, reading lists, future stuff)
4. Cloud storage
	a. Should be available locally + remotely (synchronize)
	b. Keep it organized in folders
