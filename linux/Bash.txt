====== Bash ======
Created Donnerstag 04 Juli 2019

Bash is a Unix shell and command language. It is written in C and published under the GPLv3 license.

===== Shortcuts to move faster in command line =====
Note that the following shortcuts are actually ''readline'' shortcuts, meaning they should work in every program using ''libreadline''.
''<Meta>'' is in most cases ''<alt>''.

==== Moving cursor ====
	''<ctrl>+b''				move back one character
	''<ctrl>+f''				move forward one character
	''<ctrl>+a''				move to start of line
	''<ctrl>+e''				move to end of line
	''<Meta>+f''				move forward a word
	''<Meta>+b''				move backward a word

==== Deleting ====
	''<ctrl>+d''				delete current character (delete one character forward)
	''<ctrl>+h''				delete current character (delete one character backward)
	''<Meta>+<backspace>''			cut from cursor to start of word (delete word backward)
	''<Meta>+d''				cut from cursor to end of word
	''<ctrl>+u''				cut from cursor to beginning of line
	''<ctrl>+k''				cut from cursor to end of line
	''<ctrl>+w''				cut from cursor to previous whitespace
	''<ctrl>+-''				undo


==== Paste ====
	''<ctrl>+y	''			paste last cut text
	''<Meta>+y (after <ctrl>+y)''		loop through (and paste) previously cut text
	''<Meta>+.''				loop through and past last argument of previous commands

==== Search command history ====
	''<ctrl>+r				''search command history backwards and loop through results
	''<ctrl>+s				s''earch command history forwards and loop through results
	''<esc>	''				exit search with current choice
	''<ctrl>+g				''cancel search and restore original line

==== Misc ====
	''<ctrl>+l''				clear screen
	''<ctrl>+d''				exit shell
	''<ctrl>+c''				terminate current foreground process (SIGINT)
	''<ctrl>+z''				suspend current foreground process (SIGTSTP)

===== Bash history =====
* Environment variable ''$HISTIGNORE'' allows you to set commands that will be ignored by the history, set it to a colon-delimited list of patterns.
* Special pattern '&' suppresses duplicate entries
* example:
	''export HISTIGNORE="&:ls:[bf]g:exit"''


===== Reload .bashrc w/o logging out and in again =====
1. ''$ source ~/.bashrc''
2. ''$ . ~/.bashrc''
3. ''$ exec bash''
   (or ''$ exec "$BASH"'')


===== Detach running process from a bash shell =====
1. ''$ nohup my-command &''
2. ''$ my-command''
	 ''<ctrl>-z''
	 ''bg''
	 ''disown %1''


===== Infinite bash loop =====
1. Using while-loop
	''#!/bin/bash''
	''while true''
	''do''
		''echo "Press [CTRL+C] to stop.."''
		''sleep 1''
	''done''
2. Using while loop with additional break statement
	''while true''
	''do''
		''echo "Pres CTRL+C to stop..."''
		''sleep 1''
		''if (disaster-condition)''
		''then''
			''break       	   #Abandon the loop''
		''fi''
	''done''
