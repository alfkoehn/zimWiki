Bash is a Unix shell and command language. It is written in C and published under the GPLv3 license.

===== Shortcuts to move faster in command line =====
Note that the following shortcuts are actually ''readline'' shortcuts, meaning they should work in every program using ''libreadline''.

	''<ctrl>+b''				move back one character
	''<ctrl>+f''				move forward one character
	''<ctrl>+d''				delete current character
	''<ctrl>+-''				undo

	''<ctrl>+a''								move to start of line
	''<ctrl>+e''								move to end of line
	''<Meta>+f''								move forward a word
												 → ''<Meta>'' is often ''<alt>''
	''<Meta>+b''								move backward a word
	''<Meta>+l''				clear screen

	''<ctrl>+k''				cut from cursor to end of line
	''<Meta>+d''				cut from cursor to end of word
	''<Meta>+<bckspace>''						cut from cursor to start of word
	''<ctrl>+w''								cut from cursor to previous whitespace
	''<ctrl>+y				''				paste last cut text
	''<Meta>+y (after <ctrl>+y)''				loop through (and paste) previously cut text
	''<Meta>+.''				loop through and past last argument of previous commands
	
	''<ctrl>+r				''search command history and loop through results
	''<ctrl>+g								''cancel search and restore original line
