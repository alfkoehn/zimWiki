The following tips are meant to be used on an ubuntu system to keep it clean and also to free some disk space; most of them are general linux-tips.

1. Uninstall necessary applications by going through the software manager

2. Remove unneccesary  packages and dependencies
	''$ sudo apt-get remove''
	
3. Clean thumbnail cache
	''$ rm -rf ~/.cache/thumbnails/*''
	
	 check its size before cleaning via
	''$ du -sh ~/.cache/thumbnails''
	
	 only delete files that have not been accessed for more than a year
	''$ find ~/.cache/thumbnails/ -type f -atime +365 -delete''
	 list them before deleting
	''$ find ~/.cache/thumbnails/ -depth -type f -atime +365'' 
	
4. Remove old kernels (if no longe required)
	''$ sudo dpkg --list 'linux-image*'''
	''$ sudo apt-get remove linux-image-VERSION''
	
5. Remove useless files and clean-up folders
	e.g. ''~/Downloads/'', ''~/Desktop/'', ''~/Documents/'' etc.

6. Clean apt-cache: ubuntu's software manager APT generates a cache of downloaded apps and keeps (also after apps have been uninstalled).
	check its size via
	''$ sudo du -sh /var/cache/apt''
    
	remove it with
	''$ sudo apt-get clean''
	
7. Clean ''pip'' cache
	''$ rm -rf ~/.cache/pip/*''
	
	 Note: good idea to first rename it and see if everything (pip) is still working
