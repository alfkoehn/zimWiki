===== Freeing disk space =====

1. Deleting thumbnails
	''$ rm ~/.cache/thumbnails/''
2. Deleting old files in ''~/.cache''
	$ ''find ~/.cache/ -depth -type f -atime +365''			list everything which hasn't been accessed for a year 
	$ ''find ~/.cache/ -type f -atime +365 -delete''			delete everything which hasn't been accessed for a year

	 Alternatively
	''$ find /path/to/ -type f -mtime +7 -name '*.gz' -execdir rm -- '{}' \;''
		
		''find''		the unix command for finding files/directories/links and etc.
		''/path/to/''	the directory to start your search in.
		''-type f''		only find files.
		''-name '*.gz'''	list files that ends with .gz.
		''-mtime +7''	only consider the ones with modification time older than 7 days.
		''-execdir ... \;''	for each such result found, do the following command in ....
		''rm -- '{}'''	remove the file; the {} part is where the find result gets substituted into from the previous part. 
						  ''--'' means end of command parameters avoid prompting error for those files starting with hyphen.
						
	Alternatively
	  ''$ find /path/to/ -type f -mtime +7 -name '*.gz' -print0 | xargs -r0 rm ''â€”
	
	Alternatively and slightly faster (still slightly slower than ''find -delete'')
	  $ ''find /path/to/ -type f -mtime +7 -name '*.gz' -execdir rm -- '{}' +''
