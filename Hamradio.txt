===== General tips =====
* QSO on HF
	* find open frequency
	* listen for 1 or 2 minutes to check it's clear
	* say "is this frequency in use?"
	* wait a few seconds, then repeat
	* call "CQ CQ CQ this is <call-sign> calling CQ and standing by"
	* wait a few seconds, then repeat
	* if somebody responds, write down call sign, signal report (if given), name
	* determine signal strength of your partner
	* respond "Hello <call-sign>, you are <signal-report> here is <your-location>, nice to meet you <their-name>, my name is <my-name>"
	* note: spell your name (and call-sign) in standard phonetics
	* "QSL?" sending it back to them
	* call sign + signal report = valid QSO
	* finish QSO by "Thank you <their-name/call-sign>, it was nice to meet you. 73"
	* wait for them to say goodbye
	* say "this is <your-call-sign>, QRZ"
	* when shutting off, "this is <your-call-sign> going QRT"
* some people recommend to do not call CQ on repeater
	* note that people tend to reply "do not use CQ here"
		 --> you made a QSO :)
		 --> tell them you're a beginner, that's always fine
