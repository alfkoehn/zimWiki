===== General tips =====
* QSO on HF
	* find open frequency
	* listen for 1 or 2 minutes to check it's clear
	* say "is this frequency in use?"
	* wait a few seconds, then repeat
	* call "CQ CQ CQ this is <call-sign> calling CQ and standing by"
	* wait a few seconds, then repeat
	* if somebody responds, write down call sign, signal report (if given), name
	* determine signal strength of your partner
	* respond "Hello <call-sign>, you are <signal-report> here is <your-location>, nice to meet you <their-name>, my name is <my-name>"
	* note: spell your name (and call-sign) in standard phonetics
	* "QSL?" sending it back to them
	* call sign + signal report = valid QSO
	* finish QSO by "Thank you <their-name/call-sign>, it was nice to meet you. 73"
	* wait for them to say goodbye
	* say "this is <your-call-sign>, QRZ"
	* when shutting off, "this is <your-call-sign> going QRT"
* some people recommend to do not call CQ on repeater
	* note that people tend to reply "do not use CQ here"
		 --> you made a QSO :)
		 --> tell them you're a beginner, that's always fine

===== Things to consider after getting your license =====
* Buy a radio (transceiver)
	* station: most flexible, expensive, also requires antennas, tuners etc
	* portable transceiver: if possible get an "allmode" device, roughly around 1k€
	* handheld transceiver: often VHF and UHF, try to get dualband device, around 100€
* Log your QSOs
	* Various software available, ADIF export important
* Register your call sign
	* used during QSO to check with whom you are talking
	* qrz.com is largest database
* QSL cards
	* some people are still doing this
	* there exist some design templates
