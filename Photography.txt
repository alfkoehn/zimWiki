Created Montag 29 Juli 2019

===== General tips =====
* Two camera modes should be used for vast majority of photos: Aperture priority "Av", Shutter priority "Tv"
	* Aperture prority "Av"
		* control how soft background blur is
		* f-stop number:	lower   =>	more background blur
						  higher =>        less background blur
		* increasing f-stop number might require using a tripod
		* f8 to get best overall image quality (in terms of sharpness)
	* Shutter priority "Tv"
		* control motion blur by setting shutter speed manually
		* f-stop number are set automatically
* Some iso-recommendation
	* normal daylight					iso 100,200
	* mid morning/afternoon			iso 400
	* inside building, sunset/sunrise		iso 800, 1600
	* before sunrise, after sunset		iso 3200, 6400
* Fireworks
	* Blende f5.6 - f11
	* ISO 100-400
	* Belichtung 1-20 s
* Thunderstorm-lightnings
	* only nice during night (or evening/blue hour)
		--> during day: use of Graufilter required
	* manual mode, set focus to infinity, Blende 8, Belichtung 4 s, ISO 100
		--> eventuell "bulb" Modus + Fernauslöser
		--> Blitz/Wolken überstrahlt: Blende schließen (=größere Blendenzahl)
		--> Scharf-stellen kann per live-view gut klappen
	* blitzortung.org shows real-time lightnings
* Moving water
	* program mode "Tv"
	* 1 sec for beautifully blurred water
		* use tripod, best early morning or late day
		* midday only possible with ND filters
		* iso is lowest possible
	* 1/250 sec for freezing the water
		* iso 400-1600
* Landscapes
	* sharp landscapes: use highest f-stop number
	* before and after mid-day might require a tripod to avoid blurry photos
	* golden hourse: first hour of sunrise, last of sunset
		lighting is softer then b/c sun in lower and travels through more atmosphere
	* always look for better angles
	* equipment
		* food, drinks, sunscreen, mossie repellent
		* flashlight, solid tripod, spare battery, remote (or use timer)
		* wide lens, ND filter
		* zip lock bag + elastic band (for an in-expensive rain-cover)
		* cleaning kit
* Astro-stuff
	* Sun (Canon EOS1100D)
		* White balance: cloudy
		* Blende 1/8
		* Belichtung ca. 1/1000s, ISO 100
* Set correct focus for your photos
	* single shot autofocus "AF-S" or "ONE SHOT AF"
		* works in most photo situations where subject is not moving
		* e.g. landscape, portrait
	* continuous autofocus "AF-C" or "AI SERVO"
		* sports, driving-by cars
		* use continuous shooting mode / rapid fire / sports mode
			  (take many consecutive photos to decide later which is best)
		* note: takes a lot of battery power
	* manual focus "MF"
		* still life, close-up, makro
		* for situation with very little contrast


===== Travel photo tips =====

* Choose right time of day, e.g. around dusk (30 mins time frame)
	* sidelighting is better than backlighting
	* front lighting and cloudy daytime are also good
* Photos with people on benches 
	* interesting dynamic, emotional
	* also from the back or side
	* take photos with long lens (telephoto lens)
	* use aperture priority at lowest f-stop number possible
* Use negative space to draw attention to the subject
	* negative space: when majority of composition is blank and has no detail
* Windows are nice subjects for travel photos
	* straight-on position, ensure vertical lines are straight
	* 45 degree angle of camera if first not possible
	* people in windows even better
* Put camera on ground for photographing church ceilings
	* aperture prority, f/5.6 or f/8 to have everything sharp
	* use self-timer
	* wide-angle lense (at most 50 mm)
* Street photography without being rude
	* take photos at 45 degrees angle with interesting background
	* use burst mode / continuous shooting mode
	* wait for actual shoot
	* zoom lense with help to keep distance
