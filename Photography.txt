====== Photography ======
Created Montag 29 Juli 2019

===== General tips =====
* Two **camera modes** should be used for vast majority of photos: Aperture priority "Av", Shutter priority "Tv"
	* Aperture prority "Av"
		* control how soft background blur is
		* f-stop number:	lower   =>	more background blur
						  higher =>        less background blur
		* increasing f-stop number might require using a tripod
		* f8 to get best overall image quality (in terms of sharpness)
	* Shutter priority "Tv"
		* control motion blur by setting shutter speed manually
		* f-stop number are set automatically
* Some **iso-recommendation**
	* normal daylight					iso 100,200
	* mid morning/afternoon			iso 400
	* inside building, sunset/sunrise		iso 800, 1600
	* before sunrise, after sunset			iso 3200, 6400
* **Fireworks**
	* Blende f5.6 - f11
	* ISO 100-400
	* Belichtung 1-20 s
	* Manual focus (set to infinity), trying to use autofocus on moon or distance traffic light, then set to manual
* Thunderstorm-**lightnings**
	* only nice during night (or evening/blue hour)
		--> during day: use of Graufilter required
	* manual mode, set focus to infinity, Blende 8, Belichtung 4 s, ISO 100
		--> eventuell "bulb" Modus + Fernauslöser
		--> Blitz/Wolken überstrahlt: Blende schließen (=größere Blendenzahl)
		--> Scharf-stellen kann per live-view gut klappen
	* blitzortung.org shows real-time lightnings
* **Moving water**
	* program mode "Tv"
	* 1 sec for beautifully blurred water
		* use tripod, best early morning or late day
		* midday only possible with ND filters
		* iso is lowest possible
	* 1/250 sec for freezing the water
		* iso 400-1600
* **Landscapes**
	* sharp landscapes: use highest f-stop number
	* before and after mid-day might require a tripod to avoid blurry photos
	* golden hourse: first hour of sunrise, last of sunset
		lighting is softer then b/c sun in lower and travels through more atmosphere
	* always look for better angles
	* equipment
		* food, drinks, sunscreen, mossie repellent
		* flashlight, solid tripod, spare battery, remote (or use timer)
		* wide lens, ND filter
		* zip lock bag + elastic band (for an in-expensive rain-cover)
		* cleaning kit
* **Astro**-stuff
	* Sun (Canon EOS1100D)
		* White balance: cloudy
		* Blende 1/8
		* Belichtung ca. 1/1000s, ISO 100
	* Moon (super-full-moon)
		* use a tripod
		* lens with large focal length (große Brennweite)
		* Bildstabilisator: OFF (since using a tripod)
		* manual focus, use live-view for setting focus (Lupen-Funktion in live-view)
		* 1/200 sec (since full moon is very bright), change to longer times if necessary
		* iso 100
		* f/10
		* to avoid shaking, set self-timer (2 sec) (Selbstauslöser) or use WiFi control
	* Milky Way
		* an app (e.g. PhotoPills) can be very helpful to plan where and when the Milky Way will be visible and what might be a good perspective
		* tripod should be sturdy due to long exposure times of 5-30s (wind might otherwise be a problem)
		* use manual focus
		* make test-photos during daylight when possible to set-up picture composition (and where to place camera)
		* use headlight with red light
		* to avoid star trails (long exposure times) use following formula:  500/focal length = maximum exposure time (small focal lengths better)
		* iso 1600 - 3200 (depends on noise)
		* smallest f-number possible (to let maximum light through), e.g. f/2.8
* Set **correct focus** for your photos
	* single shot autofocus "AF-S" or "ONE SHOT AF"
		* works in most photo situations where subject is not moving
		* e.g. landscape, portrait
	* continuous autofocus "AF-C" or "AI SERVO"
		* sports, driving-by cars
		* use continuous shooting mode / rapid fire / sports mode
			  (take many consecutive photos to decide later which is best)
		* note: takes a lot of battery power
	* manual focus "MF"
		* still life, close-up, makro
		* for situation with very little contrast
* **Changing the lens**
	* Clean Bajonett before removing the lens (Blasebalg, Pinsel, Reinigungsstift)
	* Red dot on lens ↔ red dot at camera
	* First protect sensor, then lens
	* Keep camera down, when removing lens (no dust can then fall into camera and onto sensor)
* **Super tele-lens**
	* always handle system at lens, not at camera body, otherwise the mount might get damaged
	* Gimbal head on a tripod is very helpful to move around camera easily
	* proberly balanced Gimbal head will stay at the position you moved it into

===== Travel photo tips =====
Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_8DVwVOX9c
* Choose right time of day, e.g. around dusk (30 mins time frame)
	* sidelighting is better than backlighting
	* front lighting and cloudy daytime are also good
* Photos with people on benches 
	* interesting dynamic, emotional
	* also from the back or side
	* take photos with long lens (telephoto lens)
	* use aperture priority at lowest f-stop number possible
* Use negative space to draw attention to the subject
	* negative space: when majority of composition is blank and has no detail
* Windows are nice subjects for travel photos
	* straight-on position, ensure vertical lines are straight
	* 45 degree angle of camera if first not possible
	* people in windows even better
* Put camera on ground for photographing church ceilings
	* aperture prority, f/5.6 or f/8 to have everything sharp
	* use self-timer
	* wide-angle lense (at most 50 mm)
* Street photography without being rude
	* take photos at 45 degrees angle with interesting background
	* use burst mode / continuous shooting mode
	* wait for actual shoot
	* zoom lense will help to keep distance


===== Time lapse =====
* Some suggestions for intervals
	* slowly moving clouds			10 seconds interval
	* normal moving clouds			5 seconds interval
	* very fast moving clouds		3 seconds interval
	* people walking down a street	2 seconds interval
	* sun on a clear day			30 seconds interval
	* night shots (moon, stars)		20-30 seconds interval
	* cooking action				1 seconds interval
* If tripod is not too heavy, hanging camera bag on it can make it less shaky (during wind)
* Use RAW 
* Focus before the time-lapse start, then set focus to manual to prevent losing/changing focus during time lapse
* Use manual setting to ensure that exposure time, iso, f-number are all the same (to avoid "flickering" during time lapse)
* Canon 80D settings
	a. Rad (um START/STOP Knopf) von Photokamera auf Videokamera drehen
	b. MENU Knopf
	c. Reiter 5 vom Kamera Menü (das erste)
	d. Zeitraffer-Movie -> aktivieren
	e. Detaileinstellungen machen -> mit OK bestätigen
	f. Auslöser leicht drücken (so wieder ins aktive Display zurück), Einstellungen machen (Manual-Modus am besten)
	g. START/STOP Knopf drücken -> Auslöser durchdrücken => Movieaufnahme ist gestartet (Display wird schwarz, oben in LCD-Anzeige wird runtergezählt)
	h. Falls frühzeitiges Beenden erwünscht, Auslöser drücken
