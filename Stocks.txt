===== Dollar-Cost Averaging vs. Lump-Sum Investing =====
* Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)
	* continuously investing same amount of money over time 
	* ignore market fluctuations
	* psychological benefit of not risking large amout of money at once
	* better suited for nervous investors with little risk tolerance
	* buying over time can bring down average cost per share if stock drops over somewhat longer time
	* if market is tending downwards, DCA outperforms lump-sum investing
* Lump-Sum Investing
	* immediate investing using all available money
	* requires higher risk tolarance
	* if market is trending upwards, lump-sum investing outperforms DCA


===== EFT =====
* Websites for getting information
	* Good overview including list of top holdings: https://www.onvista.de/etf/
	* Detailed statistics including country list: https://www.comdirect.de/inf/etfs/finder.html
* The ETF should have a minimum volume to minimize risk of getting closed
	* 100 Mio EUR should be fine
* Too little positions (too little diversity) is dangerous (only usefull as little add-on to portfolio, e.g. 10% of monthly investment)
	* EURO STOXX 50 (WKN: 965814): bad longterm performance
	* iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (WKN: A0MW0M): only 30 positions, lots of hydrogen (heavily hyped) => heavy loss from 2021-01 - 2021-03

===== Typical mistakes =====
* Don't forget your //Freistellungsauftrag// (max. 801 EUR //Sparerpauschbetrag//)
	* get earning up to this value tax-free, i.e. without paying //Kapitalertragssteuer//
* Try to not trade outside of market hours (neo-broker often offer this)
	* spread (difference between buy/sell price) can be large (especially during weekends)
* Take care to use to correct order type (//limit//, //stop loss//, etc.)
* Don't trade too much
	* look for long-term invests (5-15 years): buy and hold
