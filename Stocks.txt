===== EFT =====
* too little positions (too little diversity) is dangerous (only usefull as little add-on to portfolio, e.g. 10% of monthly investment)
	* EURO STOXX 50 (WKN: 965814): bad longterm performance
	* iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (WKN: A0MW0M): only 30 positions, lots of hydrogen (heavily hyped) => heavy loss from 2021-01 - 2021-03
