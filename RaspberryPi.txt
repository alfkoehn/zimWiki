===== Prepare SD card with linux for NOOBS =====
1. see what devices are currently mounted
	''$ df -h''
2. insert SD card
3. see, how sd card is called, e.g. ''/dev/mmcblk0p1'' or ''/dev/sdb5'' (remove partition number to get name: ''/dev/mmcblk0'' or ''/dev/sdb5'')
	$ df -h
4. unmount SD-card (unmount all partitions!)
	''$ umount /dev/sdb5''
5. list all mounted and unmouted devices, compare with and without SD-card insert to identify it
	''# fdisk -l''
6. create single partition
	''# fdisk /dev/sdb''
	''d''   			(for delete existing partitions)
7. list to check if really all partitions are deleted
	''p''
8. create new single (primary) partition
	''n''
9. list again, to check if it has worked
10. change to FAT32
	''t''
11. list again, to check if it has worked
12. write changes to SD-card
	''w''
13. format partition on SD-card (NOT whole SD-card)
	''# mkfs.vfat /dev/sdb1''
14. downloaded NOOBS
15. mount SD-card and find mount-point
	''$ mount | grep -i sdb1''
16. change into mounted SD-card (mount-point found as described in 15.)
17. unzip
	''$ unzip ~/Downloads/NOOBS_v1_9_2.zip''
18. done. unmount and insert into raspberry pi
	''$ cd && sudo umount /dev/sdb1''
