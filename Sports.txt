===== Running in the morning (German) =====
* Laufen **vor dem Frühstück** hat einige Vorteile
	* Glykogenspeicher sind schnell leer, Körper schaltet auf Fettstoffwechsel um, Körper lernt so freie Fettsäuren früher und vermehrt zu nutzen
	* Körper lernt auf Dauer, vorhandene Brennstoffe effektiver zu nutzen, was die Grundlagenausdauer steigert
	* Tag wird mit gutem Gefühl gestartet, was geschafft zu haben, man ist voll wach auf der Arbeit und i.A. leistungsfähiger
* Darauf sollte man achten beim Laufen **vor dem Frühstück**
	* Wasser vorher trinken, da der Körper nachts nur Flüssigkeit abgibt, aber keine aufnimmt
	* 30-45 min geht meist wunderbar ohne Frühstück, darüber hinaus sollte **kleiner Snack** 15-30 min vor dem Laufen eingenommen werden, z.B.
		* halbe Banana, andere Hälfte ins Gefrierfach (für den Smoothie danach)
		* Dörrobst, z.B. getrocknete Aprikose, getrocknete Dattel, Rosine
		* kleine Portion Apfelmus
		* Cracker mit Teelöffel Honig
		* eventuell wasserreiches Obst, z.B. Wassermelone, Honigmelone, Mango, Papaya, Nektarine, Pfirsich
	* Gelenke versteifen über Nacht, daher langsamer Start wichtig, eventuell ein paar Dehnübungen
	* keine intensive Einheit, eher lockerer Lauf (75-80% der maximalen Herzfrequenz) 
* Wichtig ist ausreichend essen nach dem Laufen
	* damit Fettverbrennung nicht gleich wieder stoppt, ist Protein-reiche Mahlzeit wichtig: Hüttenkäse, Quark, Spiegelei
	* Protein-reiches Frühstück macht satt und hält Nachbrenneffekt (erhöhter Kalorienverbrauch nach dem Training) hoch
	* komplexe Kohlenhydrate wichtig um leere Speicher zu füllen: Müsli mit Joghurt, Früchten, Nüssen


===== Planning routes =====
1. Strava: https://www.strava.com
	* heat map feaure very useful to find good tracks ("good" = lots of runners are using it)
	* can create routes of set distance (e.g. just setting an overall distance will create a route)
	* route planning feature not for free
2. Garmin Connect: https://connect.garmin.com
	* if owning a Garmin watch, heat map data to plan popular routes is possible
3. Komoot: https://connect.garmin.com
	* seems to have some more less crowded routes


===== Running: useful data screens on Garmin watches =====
* **Easy runs (**running by heart rate, trying to stay in zone 2)
	* average heart rate (not the live heart rate)
	* distance (or time)
* **Races**
	* distance
	* average pace
	* lap pace (for each kilometer)
	* elapsed time (advantage is this will not pause when accidentally hitting pause)
* **Hills** (intervals)
	* live heart rate (to make sure that properly recovering from hard part and getting heart rate down before next hard part)
	* laps (count each hard and relaxing part as individuals laps)
	* lap distance
	* lap time
* **Progression runs** (getting faster in e.g. 1 km steps)
	* distance
	* lap pace (for current lap, e.g. kilometer)
	* last lap pace (to ensure that current lap is faster than last lap)
* **Trail runs** (somewhere new, usually some trails, using a pre-run created route loaded to the watch)
	* map
	* distance remaining
	* average pace
* **Ultra races** (very long runs)
	* First data screen
		* distance
		* distance remaining (assumes to run a pre-loaded course)
		* time of day
		* battery level (might be worth to carry a small portable charger)
		* total ascent
	* Second data screen
		* average pace
		* pace pro
		* eta
		* calories (as a rough indicator to ensure that enough calories are consumed)
		* elapsed time


===== Running: quick warm-up =====
Taken from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI1iHQSHOQE
* 1 min: easy jog on the spot
* 1/2 min: high knees from walking
* 1/2 min: mimic hurdle movement with one leg, also known as open and close the gate: leg out, up, around to front, back down (and the other way around)
* 1/2 min: leg swings (forward and backward)
* 1/2 min: leg swings (into left and right direction)
* 1/2 min: side steps with pronouced arm swings
* 1/2 min: standing still, dynamically moving hand to toes on opposite foot (for cross body rotation)
* 1/2 min: high knees from jogging on the spot
* 1/2 min: butt kicks from jogging on the spot


===== Running hill repeats =====
* builds up leg strength
* warm-up is important including dynamic stretches, cool-down at the very end is also important
* running up fast, running down slow
* fixed distance or time
* 4 - 6 % inclination would be optimal
* 60 - 90 seconds up would be optimal, 90 sec - 3 min for pushing the lactat threshold up
* lap running watch at top and at bottom
* 90 % effort when going up
* recovery is most important when running or walking down (heart rate needs to get down, back to zone 2, monitor heart rate)
* 5 repitions for beginners, 10 for advanced runner


===== Intervalls without hills =====
**Session 1**
* Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFUz5qazxn0

===== Making nice videos of your running/cycling/hiking activities =====
1. **Relive App**: 3D animated maps overview videos
	* free version available
	* possibility to connect the app to a sports-tracker app (e.g. Garmin Connect) to get the animation
	* can also import ''.fit'' or ''.gpx ''or'' .tcx'' files from your tracking device
	* simply click on activity in //Relive App//, and then click on //Create Video //
2. **Garmin VIRB Edit**: Data overlay of track to GoPro Videos
	* free software for Mac or Windows
	* requires video from GoPro device + ''.fit'' datafile from Garmin device
	* Via the //G-Metrix// menu, the ''.fit'' file is imported, clicking on //G-Metrix Sync// is trying to automatically sync the track data to the video data


===== Trying to avoid the runner's stomach =====
* Other names: runner's trot, runner's diarrhea, the gingerbread man
* Likely due to all that bouncing up and down pushing food through your digestive system + less blood in intestines (more blood needed in legs)
* Common among distance runners
* What to do when it hits during a race
	* slow down
	* sip water (dehydration can lead to diarrhea)
	* eat something "easy" (bland)
	* use a bathroom
* How to prevent
	* stick to familar food
	* don't eat within 2 hours of racing
	* avoid high-fiber, high-fat, high-fructose, spicy food
	* be hydrated
	* if problem consist, talk to doctor and maybe take Immodium pre-run


===== Improve running form or technique =====
1. Forward lean
	* lean forward (from the angles), basically falling such that you are forced to start moving eventually
	* transit from that falling motion to a short 50 m run
	* repeat 10 times at beginning of easy run
2. Barefoot running
	* practice during a run on sand or grass
	* start with short distances, e.g. 3x 100 m, then build up
3. Strides (accelerations)
	* towards the end of an easy long run
	* 100 m (15-20 seconds) at 95 % intensity
	* 30 seconds to catch breath inbetween
	* repeat 3 times, later 10 times


===== Exercises for strength improvement for runners =====
Generally, single-leg exercises are important as running is a single-leg sport. 
Doing such a routine once per week is fine (e.g. 30 seconds each exercise, 4 reps).
1. Step-up variation (might add weights to it) 
	a. forward stepping up a chair with pushing the knee up
	b. lateral step-up and step-down a chair, keeping the other leg more or less stiff
2. Squat variation (might add weights to it)
	a. have a chair behind you, put one foot on it
	b. move down such that the knee, whose foot is on the chair, almost touches the floor
	c. classical squat also ok
3. Calf raise variation
	a. move one foot/leg slightly up that it is not touching the ground
	b. "step" up but always keep foot (rather the toes) on ground to train the calf
	c. can also be done without chair/stair/bench
4. Soleus raise
	a. stand on the edge of a step, such that only the toes are still on it
	b. other foot is free in air
	c. "step" up and down, only from moving muscles at front part of foot (always stay on that step)
5. Core exercises, hip flexor
	a. lie down, feet on a bench or chair, back on ground
	b. make a straight line with your legs (keep back on ground or also include it in straight line)
	c. put a flex-stretch-band around foot
	d. moving one knee towards your body, i.e. stretching that band
6. Some full body exercise
	a. walking around with knee pushing up and holding weights in both hands
	b. doing the same while walking on the toes
	c. bending the knees then walking around on your toes
7. Reverse lunge
	a. move one leg to the back, like walking backwards
	b. bend knee of other leg to come down with body until knee of backwards moving leg is touching ground
	c. keep back flat/stiff, whole body can move slightly forward
	d. take care that the knee-bending leg is perpendicular to the ground
8. Running dead bug
	a. lie down on your back
	b. lift both legs from ground
	c. alternate legs moving forth and back, like a bug lying on its back trying to run away
	d. don't lift head up, lie stable on ground, tense upper body
9. Single leg box hop
	a. lay out a square (box) on the ground 
	b. jump slidly sideways (lateral) on one leg from one edge to the other
	c. starting with hoping diagonally, then sideways/laterally, then diagonally ...
	d. take care to find proper balance after each landing
10. Deadlift
	a. stand straight with some weights in your hands
	b. slightly bend the knees
	c. bend your upper body forward/down and back up again, up to an angle of 90 degree between legs and upper body
11. Side Plank
	a. lie down
	b. doing a side plank, lifting the other arm up
12. Bridge
	a. lie down, feet on a bench or chair (on ground is also ok, but then have leg at an angle such that knee is not on ground), back on the ground
	b. arms on the ground next to body
	c. keep moving hip up and down
	d. if strong, single-leg is also possible (only one leg on chair, other is in air)
13. Crunch
	a. hands can support head if required 


===== Knee-strengthening exercises =====
1. Side lying hip abduction
	a. lie down on one side
	b. move leg sideways up and down (goal: 30 reps)
	c. keep moving leg straight and stiff
	d. angle foot slightly inwards
2. Foam-rolling all muscles above the knee
3. Massage with (not spiked) end of hiking pole your glute muscle
