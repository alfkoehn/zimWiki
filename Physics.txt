===== Spectrum analyzer =====
* used for measuring magnitude of input signal against frequency
* allows thus to identify a signal's frequency components
* observes signal in frequency domain
* makes absolute measurements
* **passive** measurement
* if a tracking generator (Mitlaufgenerator) is available, allows to use the specturm as a network analyzer, measuring transmission & reflection of RF components


===== Network analyzer =====
* measures transfer function of a circuit over frequency
* **active** measurement: injects signal 
* transfer function is basically output vs input
* S-parameters are most commonly measured
* used to measure the response of a device or network (reflection and transmission)
* makes relative measurements, requires a calibration
* scalar network analyzer (SNA): measures only amplitude characteristics of a device
* vector network analyzer (VNA): measures amplitude properties + other parameters like phase
* large signal network analyzer (LSNA): can be operated with large power signals


===== Frequency synthesizer =====
* electronic circuit that generates a range of frequencies from a single reference frequency
* uses frequency multiplication and division, direct digital synthesis, frequency mixing, and PLLs to generate the required frequencies
* stability and accuracy of output related to stability and accuracy of reference frequency input, which are of provided by very stable sources (crystal oscillators)


===== Quadrature signals =====
* two signals are in quadrature, when they are 90 degrees out of phase (corresponding to 1/4 cycle, hence quadrature)
* cosine and sine waves are in quadrature
* amplitude of "in-phase" signal is referred to as I, amplitude of "90 degrees shifted" signal is referred to as Q
* adding quadrature signals
	* if I and Q have same frequency and amplitude, i.e. vary identically, the amplitude of the sum varies simply with a phase shift
	* if I and Q vary differently, phase and amplitude of sum varies, thus resulting in amplitude and phase modulation of sum
* phasor diagram: Q value corresponds to amplitude, I to phase/angle
