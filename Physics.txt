===== Spectrum analyzer =====
* used for measuring magnitude of input signal against frequency
* allows thus to identify the signal's frequency components
* passive measurement


===== Networt analyzer =====
* measures transfer function of a circuit over frequency
* active measurement: injects signal 
* transfer function is basically output vs input
* S-parameters are most commonly measured
* used to measure the respons of a device or network
* scalar network analyzer (SNA): measures only amplitude characteristics of a device
* vector network analyzer (VNA): measures amplitude properties + other parameters like phase
* large signal network analyzer (LSNA): can be operated with large power signals


===== Frequency synthesizer =====
* electronic circuit that generates a range of frequencies from a single reference frequency
* uses frequency multiplication and division, direct digital synthesis, frequency mixing, and PLLs to generate the required frequencies
* stability and accuracy of output related to stability and accuracy of reference frequency input, which are of provided by very stable sources (crystal oscillators)
