===== Spectrum analyzer =====
* used for measuring magnitude of input signal against frequency
* allows thus to identify the signal's frequency components
* passive measurement


===== Networt analyzer =====
* measures transfer function of a circuit over frequency
* active measurement: injects signal 
* transfer function is basically output vs input
* S-parameters are most commonly measured
* used to measure the respons of a device or network
* scalar network analyzer (SNA): measures only amplitude characteristics of a device
* vector network analyzer (VNA): measures amplitude properties + other parameters like phase
* large signal network analyzer (LSNA): can be operated with large power signals
