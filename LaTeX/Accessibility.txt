====== Accessibility ======
Created Montag 08 Mai 2023

PDF documents creating using LaTeX do not include the document structure and tags required for accessible documents. Two methods exists trying to ensure your documents are following accessibility standards:

=== Adding tags and alt text ===
* the package **accessibility** can be used to add structure, tags, and alt text
	* package can be loaded as follows
	''\usepackage[tagged, highstructure]{accessibility}''
	* example for usage in figures
{{{code: lang="latex" linenumbers="True"
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{figure_1}
    \alt{Image of the Earth from outer space}
    \caption{Image of the Earth from the Apollo 17 mission.}
    \label{fig:earth}
\end{figure} 
}}}

	* note that the **package does not work** in the current form
* for accessible equations, the **''axessibility''** package can be used
	''\usepackage{axessibility}''
	* requires using ''equation'' environment for all equations
* the package **tagpdf** offers some tools for tagging 


=== HTML method ===
* LaTeX is quite limited in terms of accessibility at the moment, thus many experts recommends converting LaTeX document to HTML and MathML 
* ''LaTeXML'' is a command line tool converting LaTeX to XML, ''Latexmlpost'' then converts this XML further into e.g. HTML or XHTML, with option to convert math into MathML 
* Pandoc is another command line tool converting LaTeX to XML and HTML
