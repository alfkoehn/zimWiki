====== Math ======
Created Montag 04 November 2019

===== Conditional equations with a curly bracket on one side =====
The ''cases'' environment from the ''amsmath'' package is a good choice for that:
{{{code: lang="latex" linenumbers="True"
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}

\begin{document}
  \begin{equation}
    y=
    \begin{cases}
      0, & \text{if}\ x=1 \\
      1, & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
  \end{equation}
\end{document} 
}}}



===== Writing matrices =====
An easy way to writes matrices with 
	''[]'' braces is provided by the ''bmatrix'' environment, 
	''()'' braces by the ''pmatrix'' environment, 
	''||'' braces by the ''vmatrix'' environment (double lines by the ''Vmatrix'' environment)
	no braces by the ''matrix'' environment,
which are all part of the ''amsmath'' package:
{{{code: lang="latex" linenumbers="True"
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\begin{equation}
M=
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 2 & 3 \\
    3 & 4 & 5 
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

\end{document} 
}}}

To write a matrix inline, simply write
	''$M = \left\[ \begin{smallmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{smallmatrix} \right\]$''


===== Writing Equations in a math environment (display-math expression) =====
1. ''$$ ... $$''
	* old "Plain TeX" method, deprecated nowadays i.e. **should not be used** especially when using pdfLaTeX or XeLaTeX, see [[https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/503/why-is-preferable-to|here]] for details
2. ''\[ ... \]''
	* Leslie Lamport's re-implementation of the previous (''$$...$$'') method which acts as a carefully designed wrapper around that method
	* produces more helpful error messages
	* checks if being in vertical mode (i.e. being at a start of a paragraph) and avoids inserting additional vertical space
	* does not generate equation numbers
3. ''\begin{displaymath} ... \end{displaymath}''
	* exactly the same as ''\[ ... \]''  
4. ''\begin{equation} ... \end{equation}''
	* wrapper around ''$$ ... $$'' 
	* equation number is added; avoid with writing ''equation*''
	* might add some unwanted vertical space if at start of a paragraph
	* will be redefined (and optimized) when loading the ''amsmath'' package
5. ''\begin{gather*} ... \end{gather*}''
	* requires ''amsmath'' package
	* wrapper around ''$$ ... $$'' but optimizing it 
	* can add equation numbers
6. ''\begin{align} ... \end{align}''
	* Like ''gather'' but with but with ability to vertically align equations.
7. ''\begin{eqnarray} ... \end{eqnarray}''
	* **do not use** this, use the ''align'' environment instead
	* spacing around relation symbol somewhat inconsistent
	* long equaions tend to collide with equation numbers
	* sometimes there are problems with references and labels
	* note that the iop-style fixes some of the problems


===== Bold math symbols =====
* one could in pricinple use ''\textcolor{\rightarrow}'' but that destroys the spacing
* better to define a new command, that can be used exactly as ''\textcolor'' is used, but preserved the math-spacing
