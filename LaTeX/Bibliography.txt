====== Bibliography ======
Created Mittwoch 08 April 2020

===== bibtex, biber, biblatex, natbib: what are they? =====
Nice explanation: https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/25701/bibtex-vs-biber-and-biblatex-vs-natbib. The following points are basically a summary plus some additions:
* ''bibtex'' and ''biber'' are separate programs to process bibliography information
	→ corresponding to an interface between the ''.bib'' file and the [[LaTeX]] document
* ''natbib'' and ''biblatex'' are both [[LaTeX]] packages to format citations and bibliographies
	* ''natbib'' works only with ''bibtex''
	* ''biblatex'' works with ''bibtex'' and ''biber''
* ''.bib'' files are commonly referred to as "bibtex" files (note: might not make too much sense)

==== natbib (package) ====
* widely used, very reliable, but not much further development going on
* depends on ''bibtex'', its interface requires ''.bst'' files
* variety of ''.bst'' files exits
* ''makebst'' is a useful utility (part of ''custom-bib'' package) to make your own custom bibliography style

==== biblatex (package) ====
* actively developed together with ''biber'' backend
* formatting of citations and bibliography entries is done using [[LaTeX]] macros => easy to modify
* multiple bibliographies are supported directly

==== bibtex (program) ====
* stable and widely used
* hard to modify bilbiography styles
* non-ascii characters known to cause probems 

==== biber (program) ====
* allows for a larger variety of entry and field types in ''.bib'' file
* can handle UTF-8 ''.bib'' files
* only works with ''biblatex'', not with ''natbib''
	* [[LaTeX]] document has to contain 
		* ''\usepackage{biblatex}''
		* ''\addbibresource{filename.bib}''
		* \printbibliography
	* don't use ''\bibliography'' or ''\bibliographystyle'' as they belong to ''BibTeX''

//Note//: ''pdflatex'' can be simply replaced by ''lulatex'' or ''xelatex'' 


===== Citing software =====
1. One example for free software without a manual (the ''note'' field is sometimes used for the version)
	'''
	@misc{bla,
	author = {author name},
	title  = {software name (version...)},
	'''
	'''
	url    = {url}
	year   = {some year}
	}
	'''


2. ''BibLaTeX'' has ''@software'' entry type which is an alias for ''@misc'', including a ''version'' field:
	'''
	@software{foo,
	  author  = {author or organizational name},
	  title   = {software name},
	  url     = {https://hadoop.apache.org},
	  version = {0.20.2},
	  date    = {2010-02-19},
	}
	'''


3. ''@Manual'' might be a good entry for a software including a manual
	'''
	@Manual{,
	  title = {R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing},
	  author = {{R Core Team}},
	  organization = {R Foundation for Statistical Computing},
	  address = {Vienna, Austria},
	  year = {2016},
	  url = {https://www.R-project.org/},
	}
	'''


4. Citing a github repository
	'''
	@misc{foo,
	  author    = {second-name, first-name},
	  title     = {Project Title},
	  year      = {2013},
	  publisher = {GitHub},
	  journal   = {GitHub repository},
	  howpublished = {\url{https://github.com/<username>/<project-title>}},
	  commit    = {commit-number},
	'''
	'''
	}
	'''


5. Citing a github repository which has been issued a DOI using zenodo (guide how-to-do https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/ )
	'''
	@software{alf_kohn_seemann_2020_3744715,
	  author       = {Alf Köhn-Seemann},
	  title        = {{alfkoehn/fusion\_plots: First release of the 
	                   fusion\_plots package}},
	  month        = apr,
	  year         = 2020,
	  publisher    = {Zenodo},
	  version      = {v1.0.0},
	  doi          = {10.5281/zenodo.3744715},
	  url          = {https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3744715}
	}
	'''
