===== bibtex, biber, biblatex, natbib: what are they? =====
Nice explanation: https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/25701/bibtex-vs-biber-and-biblatex-vs-natbib. The following points are basically a summary plus some additions:
* ''bibtex'' and ''biber'' are separate programs to process bibliography information
	â†’ corresponding to an interface between the ''.bib'' file and the [[LaTeX]] document
* ''natbib'' and ''biblatex'' are both [[LaTeX]] packages to format citations and bibliographies
	* ''natbib'' works only with ''bibtex''
	* ''biblatex'' works with ''bibtex'' and ''biber''
* ''.bib'' files are commonly referred to as "bibtex" files (note: might not make too much sense)

==== natbib (package) ====
* widely used, very reliable, but not much further development going on
* depends on ''bibtex'', its interface requires ''.bst'' files
* variety of ''.bst'' files exits
* ''makebst'' is a useful utility (part of ''custom-bib'' package) to make your own custom bibliography style

==== biblatex (package) ====
* actively developed together with ''biber'' backend
* formatting of citations and bibliography entries is done using [[LaTeX]] macros => easy to modify
* multiple bibliographies are supported directly

==== bibtex (program) ====
* stable and widely used
* hard to modify bilbiography styles
* non-ascii characters known to cause probems 

==== biber (program) ====
* allows for a larger variety of entry and field types in ''.bib'' file
* can handle UTF-8 ''.bib'' files
* only works with ''biblatex'', not with ''natbib''
	* [[LaTeX]] document has to contain 
		* ''\usepackage{biblatex}''
		* ''\addbibresource{filename.bib}''
		* \printbibliography
	* don't use ''\bibliography'' or ''\bibliographystyle'' as they belong to ''BibTeX''

//Note//: ''pdflatex'' can be simply replaced by ''lulatex'' or ''xelatex''
