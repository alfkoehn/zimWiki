===== Balun =====
* "**bal**anced to **un**balanced" → balun
* converts between balanced and unbalanced signal
* used with many antennas and their feedlines: transform a balanced feed to unbalanced one
* balanced line: line with two conductors having equal current in opposite directions
* unbalanced line: line with a conductor and a ground (such as coax cable)
* balanced dipole antenna → unbalanced feed like coax cable (ladder line, for example would be a balanced case)

* using a balanced (e.g. dipole) antenna directly with a coaxial feed without a balun, coax can radiate and/or pick-up RF signals 
* basically 2 types of baluns used in hamradio: 
	* 1:1 (50 Ohm to 50 Ohm), typically used for resonant dipole antenna
	* 4:1 (200 Ohm to 50 Ohm, or 300 Ohm to 75 Ohm), typically used for random wire antenna
* purpose of balun is to shield transmission line from external influences
* protects flow of RF current through transmission line back and forth between transmitter and antenna
* balun is basically an RF choke, preventing //common mode current// from flowing on feedline
* ensures in directional antennas (e.g. Yagi, Quad), equal amount of RF at each side of driven element (preventing unwanted skewing of directional pattern)
* note that a balun is not an antenna ballancing device


===== LNB =====
* LNB = low noise block converter
* convert from Ku band (10.7 - 12.5 GHz) to 950 -2150 MHz
* very low noise figure
* very high conversion gain, typically over 55 dB
* some other, rare LNB working at 4 GHz and 2.7 GHz
* universal LNB has circular waveguide, two probes for vertical and horizonatal polarization
* polarization and desired local oscillator (and thus frequency) is selected by F-connector, which is only output of an LNB
	* 12 Volt and 18 Volt to switch between polarization
	* local oscillator (and thus frequenc) is selected via optional 22 kHz tone imposed to supply voltage (1 Volt amplitude), tone is present means using 10.6 GHz local oscillator (no tone 9.75 GHz local oscillator)
