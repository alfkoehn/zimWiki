===== Balun =====
* "**bal**anced to **un**balanced" → balun
* converts between balanced and unbalanced signal
* used with many antennas and their feedlines: transform a balanced feed to unbalanced one
* balanced line: line with two conductors having equal current in opposite directions
* unbalanced line: line with a conductor and a ground (such as coax cable)
* balanced dipole antenna → unbalanced feed like coax cable (ladder line, for example would be a balanced case)

* using a balanced (e.g. dipole) antenna directly with a coaxial feed without a balun, coax can radiate and/or pick-up RF signals 
* basically 2 types of baluns used in hamradio: 
	* 1:1 (50 Ohm to 50 Ohm), typically used for resonant dipole antenna
	* 4:1 (200 Ohm to 50 Ohm, or 300 Ohm to 75 Ohm), typically used for random wire antenna
* purpose of balun is to shield transmission line from external influences
* protects flow of RF current through transmission line back and forth between transmitter and antenna
* balun is basically an RF choke, preventing //common mode current// from flowing on feedline
* ensures in directional antennas (e.g. Yagi, Quad), equal amount of RF at each side of driven element (preventing unwanted skewing of directional pattern)
* note that a balun is not an antenna ballancing device
