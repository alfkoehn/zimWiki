===== How to write a paper =====
1. Producing a first draft is important
2. Suppress the urge to procrastinate
3. Before start writing the paper
	a. review and renew your literature search
	b. determine the audience (research paper, tutorial, review, which journal)
		reviewers are the gatekeepers, keep that in mind
4. Initial draft is creative part, don't correct and edit as you go (it's tempting), produce complete first draft is important
5. The "Algorithm"
	a. get started, don't procrastinate
	b. create an outline (by making list of all figures and tables, put them in paper in correct order)
	c. do not write introduction now (it's hardest part to write)
	d. begin with experimental section (it's easiest part)
	e. results and discussion (following figures and tables already there)
	f. write conclusions (could be in numbered format, makes it easy for the reader)
	g. write introduction (why/what is purpose, collect relevant essential background information)
	h. fill-in references according to your notes you made while writing
6. Final notes
	a. review journal requirements
	b. Some references
		1. "The Elements of Style", Strunk & White
		2. "Skillfull writing of an awful research paper", Murray, Anal. Chem. 2011, 83, 633
