===== Livestreaming lectures via twitch =====
* tell students to go to your twitch-page at time of class
* stream your desktop, talk through headset
	* go through slides, same as giving an offline talk
	* using wacom tablet to write equations and generally make speed slower, allowing students to follow
* advertisements might be displayed
* trolls might be there (moderator might be good)
* plan in general less content than in an offline lecture
* interact with students in online-class makes them attached to course (and maybe forces them to follow more closely)
