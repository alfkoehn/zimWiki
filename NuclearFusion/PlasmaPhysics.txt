===== Cold, warm & hot plasma description =====
**Cold plasma**
	* no effect of temperature is taken into account
	* all electrons have same velocity (no variation around averaged electron velocity)
	* ok to describe wave propagation across a plasma, if temperature is low or phase speed is large (whistlers in ionosphere)

**Hot plasma**
	* no underlying assumption on velocities
	* kinetic theory provides distribution function in velocity space
	* moments of distribution function gives contributions to sources of EM field, in turn acting on equations of kinetic theory in a self-consistent manner

**Warm plasma**
	* somewhere inbetween cold & hot
	* low-order corrections to cold plasma model gives warm plasma model
	* some dimensionsless parameters in hot plasma models are << 1 in most cases (taking advantage of this)

//Example: electron oscillations in a plasma//
	* cold plasma:	Langmuir formula for plasma frequency, pure oscillation, no dispersion, no propagation
	* warm plasma:	add Bohm-Gross correction, allows wave propagation with well-defined phase & group velocity
	* hot plasma:	well-known hot plasma dispersion with formal solution to kinetic equation, leading to e.g. Landau damping, current drive, anomalous resistivity, ion acoustic turbulence
