====== NoiseFigure ======
Created Donnerstag 07 Mai 2020

//Rauschzahl// in German

signal to noise ratio = S/N ratio = SNR

* noise figure is defined as ratio F of input S/N ratio to output S/N ratio 
* noise figure represents degradation of signal (or S/N ratio) caused by the system through which signal passes
* the lower the value the better the performance
* basically defines amount of noise added by an element to overall system
* noise factor = SNR at input / SNR at output (always greater than 1)
* noise figure is noise factor expressed in decibels: N = 10*log10 (SNR at input / SNR at output)
* more cost effective to control noise figure of a receiver than increase broadcast signal power or size of receiving antenna to achieve same signal to noise (S/N) ratio
	* e.g. reduce noise figure of LNA (low noise amplifier) by 1dB same effect as increasing diameter of antenna by 40 % (used in satellite receivers)
* sources of noise
	* thermal noise: vibrations of conduction electrons & holes; power delivered by thermal source into impedance matched load is (k_B*T*bandwidth)
	* shot noise: due to quantised nature of current flow, generation and recombination of hole/electron pairs in semiconductors, division of emitter current between base and collector in transistors; equal power density across frequency range
* noise temperature often used to represent noise power of all mechanism combined, corresponding to a pure thermal source of that temperature
* system's noise figure 
	* independent of input signal level (as long as amplifier works linearly)
	* depends on temperature of source that excited the network (noise generated by that source usually related to temperature), IEEE has adopted 290K as standard temperature at which noise figure should be determined
	* generally a function of frequency
	* independent of bandwidth (noise measurement bandwidth should be less than device bandwidth, or an error will be introduced)
	* often expressed as NF = 10 log F
* noise power contribution of separate components may be added to get overall noise
