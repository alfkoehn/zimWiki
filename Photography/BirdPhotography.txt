===== General Tips =====
* lens:
	* focal length should allow to get close to the birds (zoom in), i.e. large focal length
	* focus speed should be fast
	* frame rate should be high to get 3-5 shots per second (burst-mode)
	* using an extension tube allows to reduce minimum focussing distance of large-focal-length-lenses, e.g. Canon 1.4 extender (but also reduces light slightly)
* continuous shooting (5-10 frames per seconds), burst mode
* exposure for beginner: aperture priority (Av) with auto iso (wide aperture, i.e. small f-number, lets in more light, which allows for faster shutter speed)
		→ shutter priority if you are more advanced
* RAW allows to reduce or increase exposure (usefull when taking photos against sky (increase exposure) or of white birds (reduce exposure))
* focus area
	* generally small to ensure focus point is set correctly on birds' eyes (especially important for low f-numbers)
	* large, if taking photos of flying birds against sky
* avoid shooting against blue or white background (i.e. sky) all the time, some not too messy green background looks much nicer
* eye-level shots (birds roughly on eye-level) are usually best
* light
	* best 2 hours after sunrise and 2 hours before sunset
	* worst light is usually when sun is high in the sky (harsh or hard light), clouds are beneficial during that time as they make light more diffuse
* bird in-flight photography: 
	* shutter speed 1/1600 sec (large birds) - 1/4000 sec (small birds)
	* turn-off image-stabilization, in order to get faster shutter speeds 
	* take wind direction into account: birds land and take-off into the wind ⇒ keep your back to the wind if birds should face the camera (your side, if birds should be shown from side)
	* use continuous autofocus "AF-C" or "AI SERVO" (otherwise not possible to track birds when they are flying)
	* use focal-range limiter (e.g. 8 m - infinity) if available (unless shooting birds nearby), in order to focus onto distant flying birds faster
	* practise tracking birds during flight 
	* using a tripod + Gimbal head might be convenient for long photo sessions
	* f/4 - f/8 as a guideline
	* full manual exposure control might be a good idea to keep bird at same light when it moves around and infront of different backgrounds


===== European bee-eater (Bienenfresser, Merops apiaster) =====
* Roughly 350 - 1000 couples in Germany
	* Kaiserstuhl in Baden-Württemberg
		* small village Königschaffhausen: from parking lot at Kirchcafe (N 48°08´33″ E07°39´45″) into the direction of the wine yards, roughly in direction Endingen
		* Wanderweg **Bienenfresserpfad** 
			* starts in Ihringen at S-Bahn station (Breisgau S-Bahn)
			* ends in Königschaffhausen
			* 16 km, roughly 4 hours
	* near Merseburg in Sachsen-Anhalt
	* small population in Steinbruch Nussloch near Heidelberg
* Breeding
	* mid May - end July
	* in colonies
	* bilding caves/tunnels in sandy banks (Steifufer, Sandgruben)
