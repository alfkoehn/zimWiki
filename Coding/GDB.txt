====== GDB ======
Created Montag 18 November 2019

GDB is short for GNU Project Debugger. It is a powerfull debugging tool for C.

The code needs to be compiled with the debug flag:
	''$ gcc -g -o test test.c''

The generated executable is then passed to gdb:
	''$ gdb ./test''

Some useful gdb commands:
	''run'' 				execute the program from start to end
	''list	''						display the code
''break line_number''		set breakpoint on a particular line (followed by the line number)
''disable''				disable a breakpoin.
''enable''				enable a disabled breakpoint
''next	''			execute next line of code, but donâ€™t go into functions
''step''				go to next instruction, including functions
	''print variable_name''		display the stored value of the variable //variable_name//
	''set variable_name = 0''			set the value of the variable //variable_name//
''quit''				exit gdb
''clear''				clear all breakpoints
''continue''			continue normal execution.
