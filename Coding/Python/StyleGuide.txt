====== StyleGuide ======
Created Mittwoch 22 Juni 2022

This style guide is mostely a copy of the numpy style guide

===== Import conventions =====
{{{code: lang="python3" linenumbers="True"
import numpy as np
import matplotlib as mpl
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import scipy as scipy
}}}



===== Doctring Standard =====
{{{code: lang="python3" linenumbers="True"
"""This is a docstring.

It can be spread over multiple lines.

"""
}}}

The standard is due to a community consensus which might change in time.
Length of docstring lines should be fixed to 75 characters.

==== Sections ====
1. Short summary
	* one-line summary (not using variable names or function name)
2. Extended summary
	* few sentences with an extended description
	* clarify functionality, not implementation or background theory (which is for //Notes// section)
3. Parameters
	* description of function arguments, keywords and their respective types
	* Example:
{{{code: lang="python3" linenumbers="True"
Parameters
----------
x : type
    Description of parameter `x`.
y
    Description of parameter `y` (with type not specified).
}}}
	
	* as precise as possible for parameter types, examples:
{{{code: lang="python3" linenumbers="True"
Parameters
----------
filename : str
copy : bool
dtype : data-type
iterable : iterable object
shape : int or tuple of int
files : list of str
}}}

	* if keyword is optional, write ''optional'' after its type, e.g.  ''x : int, optional''
	* multiple input parameters having exactly same type, shape, and description can be combined, e.g.  ''x1, x2 : array_like''
4. Returns
	* description of returned values and their types
	* similar to //Parameters// section, except that name of each return variable is optional
{{{code: lang="python3" linenumbers="True"
Returns
-------
int
    Description of anonymous integer return value.
}}}
	
5. Yields
	* relevant to //generators// only
	* explanation of yielded values and their types
	* similar to //Return// section
6. Receives
	* explanation of parameters passed to a generator's ''.send()'' method
	* similar to //Parameters// section
7. Other Parameters
	* optional
	* description of infrequently used parameters
	* should only be used if function has large number of keyword parameters
8. Raises
	* optional
	* which errors get raised under what conditions
	* should only be used for errors that are non-obvious or have large chance of getting raised
9. Warns
	* optional
	* similar to //Raises// section, but for which warnings get raised under what conditions
10. See Also
	* optional
	* used to refer to related code, to direct user to other functions they may not be aware of
{{{code: lang="python3" linenumbers="True"
See Also
--------
average : Weighted average.
}}}
	
11. Notes
	* optional
	* additional information about the code, including discussion of the algorithm
	* may include mathematical equations written in [[LaTeX]] format
{{{code: lang="python3" linenumbers="True"
Notes
-----
The FFT is a fast implementation of the discrete Fourier transform:

.. math:: X(e^{j\omega } ) = x(n)e^{ - j\omega n} 
}}}
	
12. References
	* references cites in //Notes// section may be listed here
	* include as list, e.g. ''[1] J. Doe, "Some important science", Some Journal, vol. 11, pp. 1-3, 2000''  
13. Examples
	* optional (but strongly encouraged)
	* using ''doctest'' format
	* to illustrate usage, not to provide testing framework
{{{code: lang="python3" linenumbers="True"
Examples
--------

np.add(1, 2)
3

Comment explaining the second example.

np.add([1, 2], [3, 4])
array([4, 6])
