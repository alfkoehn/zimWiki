This page will contains some infos about the programming languages I usually work with.


===== Tips for better code reviews =====
1. Understand the changed code, if you don't understand it kindly ask the commiter to walk you through it
	a. read the full change
	b. draft some comments
	c. read again
2. Settle style arguments with a style guide (use existing ones or write one yourself)
3. Let computers do boring parts
	a. formatters to automate as much as possible
	b. might be healthier to direct commiter's frustation to a bot
	c. use automated compiles and code runs
4. Use code examples to demonstrate what you want to be changed instead of just saying this should be changed => be generous with code examples
5. Don't say "you"
	a. replace "you" with "we": //can we rename this ....//
	b. passive voice
	c. "What about ..."
6. Frame feedback as requests, not commands
	a. be more polite in code reviews than in everyday's speech
	b. encourage commiter to change something
7. Offer sincere praise where possible
8. Re-read your comments before submitting them
9. Aim to bring code up by one grade (not more)
10. Handle stalemates proactively (when commiter refuses to apply changes requested by reviewer and reviewer insists on those changes)
